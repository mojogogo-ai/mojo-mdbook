### Step 5: Wait for AI Training

After bot creation, wait for the AI Training Status to change from "In Progress" to "Completed". Once training is complete, you can start claiming tasks.

## 📌 Next Steps

Once you've completed the setup process, you can:

- **Complete Twitter Auto Tasks**: Earn points through automatic likes, retweets, and comments performed by your AI bot
- **Build Your Points Balance**: Accumulate both Mojo GoGo points and Roam points for future rewards and platform benefits

For detailed information on how to complete Twitter tasks and earn points, please refer to our [Earn Points](/chapters/earn-points.html) guide.

> ⚠️ **Important:** You **MUST** wait for your bot's AI training to be completed before you can claim any tasks. If the training status shows "In Progress", you will not be able to access or claim any Twitter tasks.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** There are two types of points in the system - Mojo GoGo points and Roam points. Both can be earned by completing Twitter auto tasks with your trained AI bot.
